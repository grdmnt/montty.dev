I&rsquo;m Monty, a software engineer who loves building stuff. These days, I&rsquo;m working on backend systems at Nexl in Sydney. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve worn different hats - from writing code at startups to co-founding a couple of my own ventures.
What I&rsquo;ve Been Up To
I&rsquo;ve had a pretty interesting journey in tech. Here&rsquo;s the quick version:
Right now, I&rsquo;m building backend systems at Nexl (2024). Before that, I spent some time at Sentia (2023-2024) working on all sorts of things - payment systems, matching algorithms, you name it. Ruby on Rails was my trusty companion there."><meta name=author content="Me"><link rel=canonical href=https://montty.dev/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://montty.dev/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://montty.dev/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://montty.dev/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://montty.dev/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://montty.dev/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://montty.dev/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=JetBrains+Mono:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel=stylesheet><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/extended.min.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=manifest href=/favicon/site.webmanifest><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/favicon/favicon.ico><meta property="og:url" content="https://montty.dev/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="montty.dev"><meta property="og:title" content="About"><meta property="og:description" content="Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Before that, I spent some time at Sentia (2023-2024) working on all sorts of things - payment systems, matching algorithms, you name it. Ruby on Rails was my trusty companion there.\nI had a fun time working with Ecliptic Ideas (2019-2022) where I worked on The Wine Spies e-commerce platform. Started as an engineer, ended up leading the tech side of things. Did some cool stuff like building a wine storage system and a mystery wine box feature (think gacha boxes but wines!).\nIn between, I tried my hand at the startup world. Co-founded Level One Gaming (2021-2022) where I got to play with blockchain tech, building stuff for NFTs and managing a pretty active gaming community. Also co-founded and developed The Altru (2020-2021), where we built a platform connecting NGOs with donors - managed to raise over 50k AUD for some good causes.\nTech I Work With I spend most of my time with:\nRuby on Rails (my go-to for backend work) JavaScript/React for frontend stuff Some blockchain tech (mostly NFT-related) Whatever else gets the job done! What Iâ€™m Learning These days Iâ€™m diving into some fun stuff:\nGame Dev Adventures Being a gamer myself, Iâ€™ve always been curious about how games actually work under the hood. Now Iâ€™m learning game development with LÃ–VE (love2d), and itâ€™s fascinating to build features I usually take for granted while playing - things like collision detection, game states, or even just making a character move smoothly. Thereâ€™s something really satisfying about bringing game ideas from my head to life, especially when you have to build everything from scratch. It gives you a whole new appreciation for the games you play!\nGolang Journey While Ruby has been my go-to language for years, Iâ€™m pushing myself out of that comfort zone by diving into Go. I wanted to explore a compiled language to broaden my toolkit - different problems need different tools, after all. Plus, being part of different tech communities is fascinating; you get to see how Ruby and Go developers approach similar problems in different ways. This cross-pollination of ideas actually helps me bring fresh perspectives to my day-to-day work. Itâ€™s pretty cool how learning a new language isnâ€™t just about the language itself, but about the different ways of thinking it introduces you to.\nPixel Art Recently started pixel art as a creative outlet when I need a break from coding. Iâ€™m currently focused on turning anime characters into pixel art - thereâ€™s something satisfying about capturing their essence in a limited pixel space. Here are some of my attempts:\nHina Chono from Blue Box Chinatsu Kano from Blue Box About This Site This is my little corner of the internet where I jot down interesting tech problems Iâ€™ve solved and things Iâ€™ve learned along the way. Check out my hello world post to see what kind of content to expect.\nOn Writing with AI Hereâ€™s something interesting - Iâ€™m using AI to help me write these posts. Why? Well, I love coding but writing has never been my strong suit. Rather than let that stop me from documenting stuff, Iâ€™m using AI as a writing partner. Think of it like pair programming - I bring the technical knowledge and experiences, AI helps make it readable. Everything still comes from my brain, it just helps me get it out in a clearer way.\nLetâ€™s Chat If you want to talk about code, startups, or anything else, you can find me on LinkedIn. Always happy to chat!\n","wordCount":"654","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-01-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://montty.dev/about/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"montty.dev","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://montty.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://montty.dev/ accesskey=h title="montty.dev (Alt + H)">montty.dev</a></div></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://montty.dev/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">About</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 31, 2025</span>&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;654 words&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;Me</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Hey! ðŸ‘‹</p><p>I&rsquo;m Monty, a software engineer who loves building stuff.
