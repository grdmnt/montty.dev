Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Monty, a software engineer who loves building stuff. These days, I'm working on backend systems at Nexl in Sydney. Over the years, I've worn different hats - from writing code at startups to co-founding a couple of my own ventures.

## What I've Been Up To
I've had a pretty interesting journey in tech. Here's the quick version:

Right now, I'm building backend systems at **Nexl** (2024). Before that, I spent some time at **Sentia** (2023-2024) working on all sorts of things - payment systems, matching algorithms, you name it. Ruby on Rails was my trusty companion there.

I had a fun time working with **Ecliptic Ideas** (2019-2022) where I worked on The Wine Spies e-commerce platform. Started as an engineer, ended up leading the tech side of things. Did some cool stuff like building a wine storage system and a mystery wine box feature (think gacha boxes but wines!).

In between, I tried my hand at the startup world. Co-founded **Level One Gaming** (2021-2022) where I got to play with blockchain tech, building stuff for NFTs and managing a pretty active gaming community. Also co-founded and developed **The Altru** (2020-2021), where we built a platform connecting NGOs with donors - managed to raise over 50k AUD for some good causes.

## Tech I Work With
I spend most of my time with:
- Ruby on Rails (my go-to for backend work)
- JavaScript/React for frontend stuff
- Some blockchain tech (mostly NFT-related)
- Whatever else gets the job done!

## What I'm Learning
These days I'm diving into some fun stuff:

### Game Dev Adventures
Being a gamer myself, I've always been curious about how games actually work under the hood. Now I'm learning game development with LÃ–VE (love2d), and it's fascinating to build features I usually take for granted while playing - things like collision detection, game states, or even just making a character move smoothly. There's something really satisfying about bringing game ideas from my head to life, especially when you have to build everything from scratch. It gives you a whole new appreciation for the games you play!

### Golang Journey
While Ruby has been my go-to language for years, I'm pushing myself out of that comfort zone by diving into Go. I wanted to explore a compiled language to broaden my toolkit - different problems need different tools, after all. Plus, being part of different tech communities is fascinating; you get to see how Ruby and Go developers approach similar problems in different ways. This cross-pollination of ideas actually helps me bring fresh perspectives to my day-to-day work. It's pretty cool how learning a new language isn't just about the language itself, but about the different ways of thinking it introduces you to.

### Pixel Art
Recently started pixel art as a creative outlet when I need a break from coding. I'm currently focused on turning anime characters into pixel art - there's something satisfying about capturing their essence in a limited pixel space. Here are some of my attempts:

## About This Site
This is my little corner of the internet where I jot down interesting tech problems I've solved and things I've learned along the way. Check out my [hello world post](/posts/hello-world) to see what kind of content to expect.

### On Writing with AI
Here's something interesting - I'm using AI to help me write these posts. Why? Well, I love coding but writing has never been my strong suit. Rather than let that stop me from documenting stuff, I'm using AI as a writing partner. Think of it like pair programming - I bring the technical knowledge and experiences, AI helps make it readable. Everything still comes from my brain, it just helps me get it out in a clearer way.
